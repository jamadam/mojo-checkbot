=head1 NAME

Mojo::IOLoop::Stream - Non-blocking I/O stream

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mojo::IOLoop::Stream;

  # Create stream
  my $stream = Mojo::IOLoop::Stream->new($handle);
  $stream->on(read => sub {
    my ($stream, $chunk) = @_;
    ...
  });
  $stream->on(close => sub {
    my $stream = shift;
    ...
  });
  $stream->on(error => sub {
    my ($stream, $error) = @_;
    ...
  });

  # Start and stop watching for new data
  $stream->resume;
  $stream->pause;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojo::IOLoop::Stream> is a container for I/O streams used by
L<Mojo::IOLoop>.
Note that this module is EXPERIMENTAL and might change without warning!

=head1 EVENTS

L<Mojo::IOLoop::Stream> can emit the following events.

=head2 C<close>

  $stream->on(close => sub {
    my $stream = shift;
  });

Emitted safely if the stream gets closed.

=head2 C<drain>

  $stream->on(drain => sub {
    my $stream = shift;
  });

Emitted safely once all data has been written.

=head2 C<error>

  $stream->on(error => sub {
    my ($stream, $error) = @_;
  });

Emitted safely if an error happens on the stream.

=head2 C<read>

  $stream->on(read => sub {
    my ($stream, $chunk) = @_;
  });

Emitted safely if new data arrives on the stream.

=head2 C<write>

  $stream->on(write => sub {
    my ($stream, $chunk) = @_;
  });

Emitted safely if new data has been written to the stream.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Mojo::IOLoop::Stream> implements the following attributes.

=head2 C<iowatcher>

  my $watcher = $stream->iowatcher;
  $stream     = $stream->iowatcher(Mojo::IOWatcher->new);

Low level event watcher, defaults to the C<iowatcher> attribute value of the
global L<Mojo::IOLoop> singleton.

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojo::IOLoop::Stream> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and
implements the following new ones.

=head2 C<new>

  my $stream = Mojo::IOLoop::Stream->new($handle);

Construct a new L<Mojo::IOLoop::Stream> object.

=head2 C<handle>

  my $handle = $stream->handle;

Get handle for stream.

=head2 C<is_readable>

  my $success = $stream->is_readable;

Quick check if stream is readable, useful for identifying tainted sockets.

=head2 C<is_writing>

  my $success = $stream->is_writing;

Check if stream is writing.

=head2 C<pause>

  $stream->pause;

Stop watching for new data on the stream.

=head2 C<resume>

  $stream->resume;

Start watching for new data on the stream.

=head2 C<steal_handle>

  my $handle = $stream->steal_handle;

Steal handle from stream and prevent it from getting closed automatically.

=head2 C<write>

  $stream->write('Hello!');
  $stream->write('Hello!', sub {...});

Write data to stream, the optional drain callback will be invoked once all
data has been written.
