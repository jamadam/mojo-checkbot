=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojo::Reactor> is an abstract base class for low level event reactors.

=head1 EVENTS

L<Mojo::Reactor> can emit the following events.

=head2 C<error>

  $reactor->on(error => sub {
    my ($reactor, $err) = @_;
    ...
  });

Emitted safely for exceptions caught in callbacks.

  $reactor->on(error => sub {
    my ($reactor, $err) = @_;
    say "Something very bad happened: $err";
  });

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojo::Reactor> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and
implements the following new ones.

=head2 C<detect>

  my $class = Mojo::Reactor->detect;

Detect and load the best reactor implementation available, will try the value
of the C<MOJO_REACTOR> environment variable, L<Mojo::Reactor::EV> or
L<Mojo::Reactor::Poll>.

  # Instantiate best reactor implementation available
  my $reactor = Mojo::Reactor->detect->new;

=head2 C<io>

  $reactor = $reactor->io($handle => sub {...});

Watch handle for I/O events, invoking the callback whenever handle becomes
readable or writable. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

  # Callback will be invoked twice if handle becomes readable and writable
  $reactor->io($handle => sub {
    my ($reactor, $writable) = @_;
    say $writable ? 'Handle is writable' : 'Handle is readable';
  });

=head2 C<is_readable>

  my $success = $reactor->is_readable($handle);

Quick non-blocking check if a handle is readable, useful for identifying
tainted sockets.

=head2 C<is_running>

  my $success = $reactor->is_running;

Check if reactor is running. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

=head2 C<one_tick>

  $reactor->one_tick;

Run reactor until at least one event has been handled or no events are being
watched anymore. Note that this method can recurse back into the reactor, so
you need to be careful. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

=head2 C<recurring>

  my $id = $reactor->recurring(0.25 => sub {...});

Create a new recurring timer, invoking the callback repeatedly after a given
amount of time in seconds. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

  # Invoke as soon as possible
  $reactor->recurring(0 => sub { say 'Reactor tick.' });

=head2 C<remove>

  my $success = $reactor->remove($handle);
  my $success = $reactor->remove($id);

Remove handle or timer. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

=head2 C<start>

  $reactor->start;

Start watching for I/O and timer events, this will block until C<stop> is
called or no events are being watched anymore. Meant to be overloaded in a
subclass.

=head2 C<stop>

  $reactor->stop;

Stop watching for I/O and timer events. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

=head2 C<timer>

  my $id = $reactor->timer(0.5 => sub {...});

Create a new timer, invoking the callback after a given amount of time in
seconds. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

  # Invoke as soon as possible
  $reactor->timer(0 => sub { say 'Next tick.' });

=head2 C<watch>

  $reactor = $reactor->watch($handle, $readable, $writable);

Change I/O events to watch handle for with C<true> and C<false> values, meant
to be overloaded in a subclass.

  # Watch only for readable events
  $reactor->watch($handle, 1, 0);

  # Watch only for writable events
  $reactor->watch($handle, 0, 1);

  # Watch for readable and writable events
  $reactor->watch($handle, 1, 1);

  # Pause watching for events
  $reactor->watch($handle, 0, 0);
